Rippersnapper transforms into a weird upright bipedal shark creature. His finned
twin missile launcher weapon mounts on his back in this mode. He launches his
attack on any URL, ripping it apart with his baby T-Rex arms!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rippersnapper'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rippersnapper

## Usage

    url = Rippersnapper.parse("http://www.rippersnapper.net")
    url.url       # => "http://www.rippersnapper.net" (the original url)
    url.suffix    # => "net"
    url.domain    # => "rippersnapper"

    url = Rippersnapper.parse("http://foo.bar.rippersnapper.co.uk/asdf.html?q=arg")
    url.suffix    # => "co.uk"
    url.domain    # => "rippersnapper"
    url.subdomain # => "foo.bar"
    url.path      # => "/asdf.html?q=arg"

## Notable differences between Rippersnapper and [Domainatrix](https://github.com/pauldix/domainatrix)

One of Rippersnappers goals is to be a compatible API with Domainatrix, but
there are some differences.

1.  Rippersnapper chose the method name `suffix` instead of `public_suffix`.
    Domainatrix is misleading with this name, for instance it will return
    `parliment.uk`, however this is not a public suffix, it is a private suffix
    reserved for Parliment.

2.  Rippersnapper does not parse `http://localhost:3000` at the moment.  I chose
    not to do this b/c `http://localhost.com` is a valid domain, and will parse,
    but `localhost:3000` is not a domain name, it's a hostname.  If you need it
    let me know and I will reconsider

3.  There is no `canonical`, I didn't understand the use case for it, nor why it
    is reversed.  Several google searches came up short on information.
